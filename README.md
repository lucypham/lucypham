👋 Hi, I’m @lucypham (she/her) 𓂃 ࣪˖ ౨ৎ ☻

I'm pursuing my MFA in Graphic Design at the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD). I also have a background in art history, museums, digital content creation, and indie/web zines. In my free time, I'm tending to my digital garden and knitting a handmade web. 𓋼𖤣🌱𖡼🕸️𓍊𖥧𓋼𖤣𖡼🌱𖥧𓍊🕸️𓋼🌱

I'm currently passionate about websites, coding, the World Wide Web, digital and physical archives, alternative forms of publishing, and anything else related to the World Wide Web. I used to blog quite a bit when I was younger, so the act of publishing on the Web is really fascinating to me! Sometimes, I think publishing can be a radical act. I think it can also be a tender, generous, passionate, and committed endeavor. ˚ ༘ ೀ⋆｡˚

In contrast to my disorganized self, I'm actually really interested in information architecture and making information easy to access. I am also interested in web and digital accessibility, digital literacy, and human-centered design. ✿*☘︎

Other things I'd like to talk about: arts and culture, GLAM (galleries, libraries, archives, museums), film photography, books (contemporary fiction and biographies are my favorite), and sustainability.  ⭑☼𓂃 ࣪˖ ִֶָ
