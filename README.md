👋 Hi, I’m @lucypham (she/her) 𓂃 ࣪˖ ౨ৎ ☻

I'm pursuing my MFA in Graphic Design at the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD). I also have a background in art history, museums, digital content creation, and indie/web zines. In my free time, I'm tending to my digital garden and knitting a handmade web. 𓋼𖤣🌱𖡼🕸️𓍊𖥧𓋼𖤣𖡼🌱𖥧𓍊🕸️𓋼🌱

🌱 <b>How to reach me:<b> Email (lucynpham@gmail.com) is the best way to reach me, but you should check out <a href="https://lucypham.com">my portfolio</a> (it's <i>always</i> a work in progress) or visit me on <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/lucypham">LinkedIn</a>. I update my Github README the least often, so visit my other profiles for more recent updates.
