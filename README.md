- 👋 Hi, I’m @lucypham
- 👀 I’m interested in fashion, arts and culture, museums, film photography, environmental sustainability, and more.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML/CSS, UX design, visual/graphic design, social media and marketing, and project management. (Yes, it's a lot, and I never get anything done.)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on UX projects related to museums, arts and culture, nonprofit organizations, or technology in general! I'm hoping to learn from other people. :-)
- 📫 How to reach me: <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/lucypham">LinkedIn</a> is the best way to reach me, but you should check out <a href="https://lucypham.com">my portfolio</a> when I'm done updating it.
